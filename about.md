I am a software engineer from Ukraine. I work as a technical student at [CERN](https://home.cern) 
on the [REANA](https://reanahub.io) platform for reproducible research analysis. 

Before, I spend almost three years working part-time as Data Engineering Intern at [Realeyes](https://www.realeyesit.com) while studying full-time Electrical Engineering BSc at [BME](https://www.vik.bme.hu/en/) university (and my studies are still ongoing).

I am interested in Python, backend development, distributed systems, and architecture design. It brings me joy to see how components of the system interact with each other efficiently.

I created this blog, *"A place for my tech stuff"*, to learn how to write better technical content, advance my knowledge, and share it along the way.

If you want to know more about what I am doing, 
consider:

## Not tech related

I am an introvert with short bursts of extroverted behavior :sweat_smile:. 
I love playing volleyball and watching movies, TV series, and anime.
