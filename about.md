Welcome to the *"A place for my tech stuff"* blog. I created this blog to learn how to write better technical content, advance my knowledge, and share it along the way.

I am writing about different topics in software engineering that I find interesting :nerd_face: I hope you will find something useful here. Do you want to know what topics are already covered? Check out [the tags page](/tags/).
