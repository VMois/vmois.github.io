I work as a technical student at [CERN](https://home.cern) on the 
[REANA](https://reanahub.io) platform for reproducible research analysis.
The tech stack of the platform consists of Python, Flask, Kubernetes, and more.

Besides this, I write blog posts (when the moon is in the right phase :smile:) and do some hobby programming.
I am mostly interested in backend and distributed systems 
but, recently, I have started learning about iOS development and SwiftUI.

If you want to know more about what I am doing, 
consider checking [my Polywork profile](https://www.polywork.com/vmois).

In addition, I study Electrical Engineering BSc at [Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME)](https://www.vik.bme.hu/en/).

## Not work related

I am an introvert with short bursts of extroverted behavior :sweat_smile:. 
I love playing volleyball and watching movies, TV series, and anime.
