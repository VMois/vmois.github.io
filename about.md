I am a software engineer from Ukraine. I work part-time as a Data Engineer at [WorldQuant Predictive](https://wqpredictive.com) and studying full-time Electrical Engineering BSc at [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.vik.bme.hu/en/) university. Previously, Software Engineer (Technical Student) at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/), Data Engineering Intern at [Realeyes](https://www.realeyesit.com/).

I am interested in Python, backend development, distributed systems, and architecture design. It brings me joy to see how components of the system interact with each other efficiently.

I created this blog, *"A place for my tech stuff"*, to learn how to write better technical content, advance my knowledge, and share it along the way.

## Not tech related

I am an introvert with short bursts of extroverted behavior :sweat_smile:. 
I love playing volleyball and watching movies, TV series, and anime.
